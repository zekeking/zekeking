<h1>👋 Hi there, </h1>

I'm @zekeking. My interest in coding stems from seeing automation in action, specifically how it can improve the life of the average person. As a result, I am very passionate about self-taught learning and continuing the tradition of sharing knowledge - contributing to open source projects is part of that. Some of my other interests include running and baking. 🍞 

I'm currently working on getting a blog set up and writing some scripts for tutorial videos, so think about sticking around my profile by following me. ⭐️
